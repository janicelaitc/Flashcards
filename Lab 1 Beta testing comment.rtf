1.	When putting the front label below the back label, somehow the back label is showing as the top label, had to start a new project again and everything was fine after that.

2.	 For section 4.1: The easiest way to do this is to select both labels by holding the option key and clicking on both labels, this should be the command key.

3.	 Personally I think that for a more accurate instruction, section 4.5 should say something about how to actually implement the 'isHidden'property and where should this command be placed.

4.	 An error/bug showed up when I was implementing the tap gesture and it disconnected my front and back label and showed the following message, I had to reconnect the labels with the code. I believe this problem has to do with the new updates on Xcode.
