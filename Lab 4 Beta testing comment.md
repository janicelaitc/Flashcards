## Lab 4 Feedback

## Required part
 Overall this lab is fairly easy and straightforward as the previous lab. I did find a minor wording part to be confusing: 2.Animation everywhere, part 1. flashcard flip: For the UIView.transition of flipFlashcard (), it will be less confusing to explicitly say “in the flipFlashcard function” instead of “At the top of flipFlashcard”, since i was unsure whether it is referring to the top part of where we call out the function, or the top part of function itself. 
 
 It took me about 2-3 hours to complete this week's lab and within that 2-3 hours i would say i dedicate about 1-1.5 hours trying to figure out how to have the slide annimation for the previous button (i tried to use an if statement in the animate in and out function that we already have, but ended realized it is not working for me and i just created a new animate in and animate out functions)
