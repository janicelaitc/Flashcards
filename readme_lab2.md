## Flashcards

### App Description
The app allows user to add another flashcard by clicking the "+" sign, which switches from the main view to a secondary view where it allows user to input new question and new answer. Also, if the user fail to enter either the new question or new answer in the secondary view, there will be an error message showing that an question/answer is needed. There is also an "edit" button on the bottom of the app where user can edit existing flashcard.
